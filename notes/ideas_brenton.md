# Ideas - Simple Calendar / Schedule

## It should be able to...

### Display
- Show Day
- Show 3 Days
- Show Week
- Show Month
- multi-calendar screen (like macbook multi desktop screen)
- Name Calendar
- add event (start[, end], name, description)


### Feature
- sync link | a link that is used to add members to a calendar - There will be a single source of truth which is the creators
kind of like git clone as collaborators (the owner sets the rules of the calendar)
- users can connect with other users via email or username
  - users can join other users calendars via sync links which creates a group
  - A user can not view a calendar they have not been invited to see
  - A user can not edit a calendar they have not been invited to see
  - A user can not delete a calendar they have not been invited to see
  - A user can add a phonetic name to another user so they can dictate the calendar to do specific things

- a history is recorded of calendar events (DB - we can use data for feature at a later time)
- users can sync other calendars
  - a user can sync their facebook birthdays
  - a user can sync their google calendar birthdays 
    - with the option to remove specific ones
- groups
  - I can belong to multiple groups
  - I can be scheduled on to different activities at the same time
  - I have one master calendar that shows all of my scheduled events
  - As a group co ordinator I am able to see when people have blacked out dates
