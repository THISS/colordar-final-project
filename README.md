# Color.
### A social calendar for your group
Color is a social platform for planning events. Create groups, add people to those groups, it is a calendar for the average person - not power users ;)

## The Challenges
- When building color, we as a group set out to learn a current technology (**Redux**) and integrate it into our final project. We started by planning which you can see in our _notes_ directory, after planning we started doing tutorials regarding redux. After the first weekend we began writing code while making sure we all had a grasp on how redux worked and how it interacted with react.
- Another challenge popped up later on in the project when we decided to integrate **jQuery** with **reactjs** - The reason why this became a challenge as we had race conditions of which would interact with the DOM first and would that stop the other from completing its task. This forced us to change the calendar that our app was using to a less maintained but built in react calendar.

## Final Thoughts
- Color is going to be an ongoing sandbox that we will play in and improve on what we have created with things like making it a progressive web app among others.
